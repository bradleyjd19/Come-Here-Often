# Friend-Finder
Friend Finder - Letterkenny Match is a full-stack "matching" application that determines which Letterkenny character a user is most compatible with by taking the user's responses to a survey and comparing them to each character's responses.

## Demo
A demo of the application can be found on Heroku at https://young-reaches-54208.herokuapp.com/

## Instructions
- From the Home Page, click the "Begin Survey" button to display the survey form.
- Please provide your name and a photo link in the corresponding input fields, so your profile can be added to the friends list!
- There are 10 survey statements. For each one, respond with how much you agree or disagree with the statement. The responses are scale-based with 1 being strongly disagree (or "Hard No") and 5 being strongly agree (or "Can Confirm"). For the best results, please enter a response for each statement.
- Once complete, click the "Submit" button to reveal your Letterkenny Match!
